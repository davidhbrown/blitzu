# Blitzu headlamp simulator

For a number of years when teaching CSC 305 (Software Engineering), I've
brought in a few of Blitzu's Cyclops 120H headlamps and passed them around
to show an example of a device that could be implemented with a simple state
machine.

As class sizes got larger — and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic —
this became increasingly cumbersome despite buying and bringing in a few spares.
So, I wrote this simple web page to simulate the operation of the headlamp.

Of course, time and product lines move ever on and the Cyclops 120 is no longer
a current offering. Interestingly one of the replacements had a subtly different
firmware, responding while the button was held down instead of when it was
released. I'll probably leave that as an "exercise for the reader" to tweak
this JavaScript to simulate that.
